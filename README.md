<b>Transfer Learning </b> is a Deep learninng techniques where we use a pre-trained model.This pre-trained model is trained for one task and can be re-trained for similar task with smaller dataset.

Transfer Learning gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch.

<br><b><p style="color:#00008B">Examples of Pre-Trained Models:</p></b></br>
<li>VGG-16</li>
<li>ResNet50</li>
<li>Inception</li>
<li>MobileNet V2</li>
